Exploratory data analysis is a vital step in a data science project or process and helps to understand the data better. There are many reasons why EDA is necessary, including the following:

- It helps to identify the relationships and patterns between various features in a dataset. These patterns cannot be found immediately by looking at the raw data.
- EDA also helps to find or identify any potential outliers or anomalies in the dataset. Outliers can have a significant impact on the ML model or data analysis results. So, removing outliers or dealing with outliers becomes a critical part of the data science process. If you want to read more about outliers you can read my article here.
- EDA is also very useful in the data-cleaning process. Data scientists or data analysts ensure the proper formatting of data as EDA can identify the issues in the dataset and using this information data scientists can clean and preprocess the data before further analysis.
- EDA helps to interpret the data using data visualization and statistical techniques. We can interpret our results using various graphs in a more accessible and more understandable way which can improve the communication of the results.

# Importing Data
- The CSV file  was provided by our professor.
- Imported the data to Jupyter Notebook.

# Data Preparation and Modelling 
- Cleaned data and checked for missing values 

# Libarties used 
- Numpy

# Insights

- Engine size to price: We can see high linearity in the scatter plot, we can say if the engine size increases the price also increases.
- Highway-mpg to price: The scatter plot is non-linear, and also observed that, as price increases the miles per gallon decrease.
- Peak-rpm to price: In this scatter plot, we can see that it is non-linear in nature, in most cases, as price increases peak-rpm decreases.
- Body style to price: In the visual, we can see convertible and hardtop models are expensive.
- Engine location to price: Front-engine cars are cheaper than rear-end.
- Wheel drive to price: Rear-wheel drive is more expensive than all-wheel and front-wheel drive.
- Toyota produces more cars than other brands, there are more front-wheel drive cars than 4-wd and rear wd in the data set, the data consists of more sedan-type cars.
- Cars with high horsepower are expensive.
